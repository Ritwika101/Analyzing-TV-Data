# Analyzing-TV-Data
This notebook explores some analysis of TV Data for example What are the most extreme game outcomes? How does the game affect television viewership? How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time? Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances? The dataset and sample notebook have been taken from Datacamp, where I wrote the code for the various sections of the project.
